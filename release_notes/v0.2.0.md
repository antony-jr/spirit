# Spirit v0.2.0 üëª

This is the next major release of Spirit, yet still needs a lot of time to reach v1, this
is my best efforts to show what Spirit is meant for. From here on we will build upon this
idea and add new features.

This version gives you support for all major platforms not just GNU/Linux which includes
**Apple macOS** and **Windows**. But Wayland is still out of reach, yet progress is made.

Please grab fresh binaries for your platform and try out, if you like it please leave a ‚≠ê
at Github.

## Changelog

 * Support for MacOS and Windows.
 * REST API for Spirit
 * Spirit Manager GUI
 * Spirit File Specification
 * More accurate window tracking under Linux.
 * Bugfixes
