# Settings

Settings can be used to change core behaviour of Spirit in your desktop. User should **Quit** and start
their Spirit in order to see the new settings in effect.

Open Settings dialog from **File -> Settings**. 

You can set a defaul "Spirit File" which will be used on the next initialization of the "Spirit",
this can be useful in case you want to run this at each startup. By default this is the one which
is embedded in the applications itself.

In settings you can add or remove allowed programs, if you add any program in the allowed programs 
list then only programs listed in the list will be in effect with Spirit. The program should be the 
process name and not the title bar name.
