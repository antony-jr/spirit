# Loading a Spirit File

Spirit Manager can be used to load files with **.spirit** extension which are so called "Spirit Files"
which are technically zip archives and contains assets and instructions to animate the assets.

User can load a new "Spirit File" from the file menu present in the Spirit Manager.

**File -> Load**.

File select dialog will open, select a valid spirit file and click ok, the new Spirit will be initialized
automatically.

## Using CLI

```bash
 $ ./spirit.AppImage load path/to/spirit-file.spirit
```
