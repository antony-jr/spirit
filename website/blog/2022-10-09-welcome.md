I'm the author of Spirit, and Docusaurus v2 seems to provide a free blog. So I thought why not use it.
This project was on my head for very long time but I just kept avoiding it, finally I can now release 
a decent version of my idea. This idea is not inspired from MaCoPix or Shimeji but found the both when 
people mentioned it at Reddit,

Anyways Spirit is going to be very different from both, but obviously very similar to MaCoPix than
Shimeji but kind of like a mix. But I don't think Spirit will be playing all over your desktop which
can be messy. I like tha approach of using only the active window rather than the entire desktop.

So this is the first blog post to welcome everyone, I will be posting some tricks and tips on how
to use Spirit.
